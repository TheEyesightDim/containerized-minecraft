# Containerized Minecraft for Podman (and Docker too I guess)

A container solution for a Fabric MC server with automated backups and mods.

Based on itzg's [docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) and [docker-mc-backup](https://github.com/itzg/docker-mc-backup) projects.

## Directions (W.I.P.)

Clone this repo, and then in the local root run `podman-compose up -d` to start the server.
There are many options which can be configured at runtime, so please read itzg's documentation for both projects.
